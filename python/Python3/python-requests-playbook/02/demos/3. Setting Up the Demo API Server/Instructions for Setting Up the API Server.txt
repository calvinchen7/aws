Inside of it find the "API Server" directory.
This directory contains the "main.py" server script and the "requirements.txt" file.

Only you know how Python is set up on your machine, so these commands are what you would usually use for the default installation.
If you have a different setup, you just need to figure out how to install the dependencies and then you can run the "main.py" file.



Enter the file in the Terminal (or Command Prompt).



Create the virtual environment:
python3 -m venv venv

On Windows:
python -m venv venv



Activate the environment:
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate



Install all of the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Once they are installed, you can run the FastAPI server:
python3 main.py

On Windows:
python main.py



You can exit the env at any time with:
deactivate



This will run the server on your localhost address 127.0.0.1 port 8000.
Add /docs to the address to see the automatically generated Swagger documentation of the API.
