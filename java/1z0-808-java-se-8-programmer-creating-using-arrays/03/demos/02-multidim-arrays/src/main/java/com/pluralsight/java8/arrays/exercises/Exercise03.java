        //       Initialize the elements with a continuous sequence starting at the value 1,
        //       starting from element [0][0], going over the rows and columns until the end.
        //       Note: Not all elements of the top-level array necessarily have the same length.
        //       The result might be, for example, an two-dimensional array that looks like this:
        //          {{1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}, {6}, {}, {7, 8, 9}}
        //      Hint: Use a counter to generate the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... and use nested loops.
